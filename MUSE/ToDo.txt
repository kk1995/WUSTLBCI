To do

Find out how to get more than 10 seconds of EEG and acc data on mat file
  (maybe buffer size)
Find out the actual meaning of the data (units, stuff)
Find out whether and where we can put another function to read mat file and do real time analysis.
Look into papers that:
  Show significant characteristic for that certain task (alpha power difference? phase-amplitude coupling?)
  Show method to filter out eye noise
